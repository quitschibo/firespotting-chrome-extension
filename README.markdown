## Firespotting Chrome Extension  


This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the latest ideas from [Firespotting](http://firespotting.com). It also features a link for submitting the url of the current tab and, optionally, desktop notifications of the current #1 idea.

This is a fork from Adam Albrecht's Hacker News Chrome Extension - Thank you very much.
